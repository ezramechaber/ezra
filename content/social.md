**Since 2015, I've helped Precision Strategies tackle challenges for nonprofits, political campaigns, Fortune 50's, and Silicon Valley startups.**

We've helped influencers organize around trans rights:

And helped a presidential candidate shout out One Direction:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The boys are right. We need everyone&#39;s help to get the planet moving in the right direction. <a href="http://t.co/rNQSBSmgJ8">http://t.co/rNQSBSmgJ8</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/action1D?src=hash">#action1D</a></p>&mdash; Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) <a href="https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/619265009651163136">July 9, 2015</a></blockquote>

**From 2011 to 2015, I worked in the Obama White Houseâ€™s [Office of Digital Strategy](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/09/us/politics/a-digital-team-is-helping-obama-find-his-voice-online.html).**

I created the White House's first-ever Tumblr (back when that was _cool_); created hundreds of GIFs; helped develop social across Facebook and Twitter; and even helped lead live events through Reddit, Google+, and Tumblr.

I helped write this:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bo, stop trying to make fetch happen. <a href="http://t.co/Ez6hWGFpFc">pic.twitter.com/Ez6hWGFpFc</a></p>&mdash; White House Archived (@ObamaWhiteHouse) <a href="https://twitter.com/ObamaWhiteHouse/status/367301180910624768">August 13, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
And created this GIF series, which is _still_ getting shared on Tumblr:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
And because the White House hosts world-class concerts and we had the distribution rights, I started our SoundCloud with some of those recordings:
