I do digital strategy. I help campaigns, non-profits, and companies do stuff—recruit volunteers, raise money, look cool—online. I'm based in Brooklyn (ugh, right?).

From 2011 to 2015, I worked in the Obama White House's [Office of Digital Strategy](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/09/us/politics/a-digital-team-is-helping-obama-find-his-voice-online.html), running the [We the People petitions platform](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov), starting the White House [Tumblr](http://obamawhitehouse.tumblr.com/), and finding new ways to communicate with the American people.

Now I work with a bunch of very smart people at [Precision Strategies](http://precisionstrategies.com), doing pretty much the same stuff.

I was born on a [farm](http://www.hopestill.com) in Massachusetts, and spent four years in Washington, DC. I also spent a smattering of time in Arizona, upstate New York, and Cape Town, South Africa. I listen to a *lot* of music, the result of being a recovering DJ.
